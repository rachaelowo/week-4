    <h3>Tailoring</h3>
    <p>
        I have learned to sew clothes, which gives me a good understanding of how clothes are made.<br>
        I also appreciate the art of designing and fitting garments, even though I didn’t create them myself.<br>
        This knowledge helps me see the value of well-made clothing and how it can enhance a person's style.
