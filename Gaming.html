            <h2>Gaming: My Escape from Boredom</h2>
            <p>This is one of my favorite hobbies; gaming is an escape from boredom.</p>
            <p>I use platforms like the <em>PlayStation 5</em> or <em>Xbox</em>; sometimes, I even game on my mobile phone and laptop.</p>
            <p>I love playing mystery games, role-playing games (RPGs), First Person Shooter(fps) and action games, especially those with missions that keep me engaged.</p>
            <p>Some of the games I frequently play are:</p>
          <ul>
                <li>PUBG</li>
                <li>FINALS</li>
                <li>MONOPOLY GO</li>
                <li>CALL OF DUTY</li>
                <li>GENSHIN IMPACT</li>
         </ul>
                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <p>I started gaming with my mobile phone, then I got a laptop and started using my Xbox. My love for FPS grew as I played titles like Call of Duty and PUBG.</p>
                <h2>Current Interests</h2>
                <p>Today, I enjoy a mix of genres, from action-packed shooters to deep narrative-driven games. Gaming has not only been a hobby but a way to connect with friends and express creativity.</p>
